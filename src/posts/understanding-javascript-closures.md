JavaScript closures are one of the most powerful and often misunderstood concepts in the language. Understanding closures is essential for writing effective JavaScript code.

## What is a Closure?

A closure is created when a function is defined inside another function, allowing the inner function to access variables from the outer function's scope.

```javascript
function outerFunction(x) {
  // This is the outer function's scope
  
  function innerFunction(y) {
    // This inner function has access to 'x'
    return x + y
  }
  
  return innerFunction
}

const addFive = outerFunction(5)
console.log(addFive(3)) // 8
```

## Practical Examples

### 1. Private Variables

```javascript
function createCounter() {
  let count = 0
  
  return {
    increment: () => ++count,
    decrement: () => --count,
    getCount: () => count
  }
}

const counter = createCounter()
counter.increment() // 1
counter.increment() // 2
console.log(counter.getCount()) // 2
```

### 2. Function Factories

```javascript
function createMultiplier(multiplier) {
  return function(number) {
    return number * multiplier
  }
}

const double = createMultiplier(2)
const triple = createMultiplier(3)

console.log(double(5)) // 10
console.log(triple(5)) // 15
```

## Common Use Cases

Closures are everywhere in JavaScript:

- Event handlers
- Callbacks
- Module patterns
- React hooks
- Currying functions

Understanding closures will make you a better JavaScript developer and help you write more elegant, functional code.
