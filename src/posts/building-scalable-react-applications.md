Building scalable React applications is crucial for long-term success. As your application grows, you need to ensure your codebase remains maintainable and performant.

## Key Principles

### 1. Component Architecture

Start with a solid component architecture. Think of components as LEGO blocks - they should be reusable and composable.

```jsx
// Good: Reusable Button component
const Button = ({ variant, children, onClick, ...props }) => {
  return (
    <button 
      className={`btn btn-${variant}`}
      onClick={onClick}
      {...props}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  )
}
```

### 2. State Management

Choose the right state management solution for your needs:

- **Local State**: Use `useState` for component-specific data
- **Context**: Great for theme, auth, or configuration
- **External Libraries**: Redux, Zustand, or Jotai for complex state

### 3. Code Organization

Organize your code in a way that scales:

```
src/
  components/
    ui/           # Reusable UI components
    layout/       # Layout components
    forms/        # Form-specific components
  hooks/          # Custom hooks
  utils/          # Utility functions
  types/          # TypeScript types
```

## Performance Considerations

Always keep performance in mind as you scale:

- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Implement proper code splitting
- Optimize bundle sizes
- Monitor performance metrics

The key to scaling React applications is to think ahead and establish good patterns early in your development process.
